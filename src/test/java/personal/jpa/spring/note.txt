it seems that when you using spring with JPA, the persistence.xml in META-INF is not used.
you define everything inside of spring's configuration files.

Please Note:
Hibernate has settings about current_session_context_class and transaction.factory_class.
It has getCurrentSession() method to deal with context session.
But, JPA don't have these things, if you want to use jpa with spring, and using transactional control, using
@PersistenceContext.

for example using @PersistenceContext, see
"Implementing DAOs based on plain JPA"
in spring tech doc.
