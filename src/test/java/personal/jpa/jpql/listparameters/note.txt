https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1557085/setting-a-parameter-as-a-list-for-an-in-expression

according to above link:
"I found the answer, providing a list as a parameter is not supported in JPA 1.0; however, it is supported in JPA 2.0."

you have query:
"... AND c.repCode IN (:repCodes)"
and you have:
List<String> repCodeList;
you can use:
query.setParameter("repCodes", repCodeList);
