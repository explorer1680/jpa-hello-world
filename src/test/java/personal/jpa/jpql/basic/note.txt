It seems that in Intellij IDEA, the
@GeneratedValue, @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
will be Sequence, where in Eclipse, it is Identity.

Note, it is not because of Hibernate, JPA, or EclipseLink
It is because of IDE!

Note, When I try again, it seems works again. It is looks wired.

The phenomenon:
When there is only @GeneratedValue
you don't have each ename print out.
and you have "Max salary: null"

When using:
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
it show the ename and show "Max salary: 40000.0"
