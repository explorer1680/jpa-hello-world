if you have a aggregate function in jpql, the db will do the job.
For example if you have a jpql:
SELECT SUM(...) FROM ...

the show in hibernate are:

select
    sum(...) ...
    ...


In JPA, you have @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotation used in classes.
they are both used in object navigation.
But in sql or jpql, only @ManyToOne relationship.

For example:

class Parent {
    @OneToMany
    Child children;
}

class Child {
    @ManyToOne
    Parent parent;
}

in navigation, you can use parent.children, or child.parent.

in jpql:

you can only use:

SELECT p FROM Parent p, Child c
WHERE p.firstName = 'ABC'
AND c.parent = p
AND c.age > 10;



You can't use:

SELECT p FROM Parent p
WHERE p.firstName = 'ABC'
AND p.children.age >10;
