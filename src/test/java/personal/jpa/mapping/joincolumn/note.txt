this example is similar to hibernate collection.entity.joincolumn

you have to add
@Column(unique = true)
in Product to make it works.

and, here, there is a FK generated.
You can see, the different implementation will have different result.

Also noted, there is a SEQUENCE table generated, what is this for?
