In JPA, it is ok to have FK(@ManyToOne) inside of @Embeddable object.
But, if you using this @Embeddable object as a @EmbeddedId, it may or may not works, it depending on the JPA provider.
The, Hibernate provider support it, but, the eclipseLink provider not support it.

The error message like:

An embeddable class that is used with an embedded ID specification 
(attribute [emClass] from the source [class personal.jpa.jpql.component.Example]) can only contain basic mappings. 
Either remove the non basic mapping or change the embedded ID specification on the source to be embedded.
