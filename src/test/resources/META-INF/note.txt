It seems that, when you working with hibernate, the configuration for hibernate is needed, and the configuration for the jpa is not needed.
Note 1:
You can defined with hibernate properties, and also, you can define jpa properties.

In JPA v1.0, the properties in persistence are not standard. In JPA v2.0 and above, some of the properties are standard.

full list of standard properties list:

Note 2:
Using
<exclude-unlisted-classes>true</exclude-unlisted-classes>
to only scan the class defined by <class>

I think for JPA 2.1, both SE and EE, the default value for <exclude-unlisted-classes> is false.
So, by default, it will scan the whole project for you, but, in Eclipse, only classes defined in main/java can be scanned.
That's why you need add <class> for classes in test/java.
